program 1
Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Rectangle
{
	int length,breadth;
	public:
		Rectangle()
		{
			length=0;
			breadth=0;
		}	
		Rectangle(int a)
		{
			length=a;
			breadth=a;
		}
		Rectangle(int a, int b)
		{
			length=a;
			breadth=b;
		}
		void ans()
		{
			cout<<length*breadth<<endl;
		}
};
main()
{
	Rectangle r1,r2(12),r3(2,3);
	r1.ans();
	r2.ans();
	r3.ans();
}
